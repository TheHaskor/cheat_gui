the theoretical results.
what do you do?
There are 2 options:
    1) try to explain the results and search a lot of articles - hard work.
    2) change you results (just a little bit) using the "cheat_gui" - easy and promising.
	
Todos:
    1) add uncrenaties.
	2) add gui.
	
Note: * added video to demonsrate how to use *
